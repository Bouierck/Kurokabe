regles: Nurikabe is an island formation puzzle. Unlike other logic puzzles, Nurikabe is solved by partitioning RTALthe clues with walls according to the rules so that all the islands are isolated and there is a continuous path to all the walls.RTALRTALLPuzzles in Nurikabe come in many sizes and range from very easy to extremely difficult, taking from five minutes to several hours to solve. RTALHowever, make a single mistake and you'll find yourself stuck later as you get closer to the solution...RTALRTALRTALLThe principle is simplePERTALRTALYou have a grid like the one belowRTALLThe goal is to blacken out some of the squares, and keep the others blank. RTALYou must respect the following rulesPE RTAL Rule 1 PEach group of adjacent white squares (having one side in common) must contain one and only one numberRTAL Rule 2 PELThe number of squares forming an island must be equal to the number written in the islandRTAL Rule 3 PEThe black squares must be connected to each otherRTAL Rule 4 PEI There cannot be any black squares that go all the way around an islandRTAL Rule 5 PEThere cannot be a square of 4 black squaresRTALRTALRTALThere are variations in the rules that forbid squares of 4 white squares, or which allow loops on black squares. ...RTALThe real 'official' rules are applied here, i.e. the 5 rules specified above. RTALIf you play Nurikabe elsewhere, check the rules beforehand, otherwise the grids may be impossible.RTALRTALNurikabe is a mix between Mosaiku and Fillomino.
tech0: Nurikabe is an island-forming puzzle based on a rectangular grid with clues in various places. RTALRTAL    The object is to create islands by partitioning between clues with walls so that each island contains exactly one clue RTAL    and the number of squares in each island equals the value of the clue. In addition, all islands are isolated from each other horizontally and vertically, RTAL    there are no wall areas of 2x2 or larger, and all walls form a continuous path when the puzzle is completed. RTALRTAL    In the example below we have a 6x6 Nurikabe puzzle with six columns and six rows. We now need to surround the clues with walls according to the above rules… but how?
tech1: 1. Island of 1RTALRTALSince this is an island with a single square we can surround it with walls by shading the horizontally and vertically adjacent squares.
tech2: 2. Clues separated by one squareRTALRTALAccording to Nurikabe rules, all clues must be partitioned from each other with walls. RTALTherefore when two clues are in the same row or column and separated by one square, RTALthe square in between must be a wall.
tech3: 3. Diagonally adjacent cluesRTALRTALSimilar to the example above, when two clues are diagonally adjacent RTAL    then each of the squares touching both clues must be part of a wall.
tech4: Basic techniquesRTALRTAL    We now continue with the basic techniques, where it is usually easy to see which squares are part of a wall and should be shaded, RTAL    and which squares are part of an island and should be marked with a dot. Here are some ways of using the basic techniques:RTALRTAL    1. Surrounded squareRTALRTAL    After solving the first steps using the starting techniques described above, the puzzle in the left diagram below has RTAL    two surrounded squares highlighted in red. Since these squares are surrounded by walls horizontally and vertically they cannot belong to an island and must therefore RTAL    be shaded to be part of a wall.
tech5: 2. Wall expansionRTALRTAL   According to Nurikabe rules, all walls must form a single continuous path. Looking at RTAL    the single-square wall in the left diagram below, the only way to make it connect with the other walls is by expanding it with three squares on its right RTAL    as shown in the right diagram.
tech6: 3. Wall continuityRTALRTAL    In the puzzle below, if the highlighted square is part of an island then the wall on the top will become partitioned. RTAL    Therefore, to maintain wall continuity according to Nurikabe rules, this square must be part of a wall.
tech7: 4. Island expansion from a clueRTALRTAL    In many cases it is clear how an island can be expanded directly from a clue. In the diagram below, the island of 3 RTAL    can only be expanded upwards and the island of 7 can only be expanded leftwards. We will mark these squares with dots to show RTAL    they are part of the respective islands and cannot be part of a wall.
tech8: 5. Island expandable only in two directionsRTALRTAL    In some cases an island of 2 or the last square of a larger island can only be expanded in two perpendicular directions. RTAL    When this happens, regardless in which direction the island expansion will take place, the diagonal square must be part of a wall and is RTAL    therefore shaded as shown in the right diagram below.
tech9: 6. Hidden island expansionRTALRTAL    Sometimes an island is too large to fit in a given area. In the partially solved puzzle below, RTAL    the island of 12 cannot fit in the area at the top and must therefore expand downwards as marked with a dot in the diagram on the right. RTAL    Note that now the square to the left of this dot cannot belong to any island and is therefore shaded to be part of a wall.
tech10: 7. Island continuityRTALRTAL    The square marked with a red dot in the left diagram below must be part of an island to avoid a wall area of 2x2. RTAL    This means the square to its left must also be part of the same island and is therefore also marked with a dot. RTAL    The island of 3 is now completed and we can surround it with a wall.
tech11: 8. Surrounding a completed islandRTALRTAL    In the partially solved puzzle below, the island of 3 has been completed as shown in the highlighted area. RTAL    We can now surround this island with horizontally and vertically adjacent walls as shown in the right image.
tech12: 9. Avoiding wall area of 2x2RTALRTAL    According to the rules it is not allowed to have wall areas of 2x2 or larger. Therefore RTAL    the highlighted square below cannot be part of the wall and is marked with a dot showing it belongs to one of the islands.
tech13: 10. Unreachable squareRTALRTAL    In some cases a square cannot belong to any island simply because no clue can “reach” it. RTAL    In the example below the two highlighted squares are too far from the clues and cannot be part of any island. RTAL    They are therefore shaded to indicate they must be part of a wall.
